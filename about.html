      <h1 class="me">About Me</h1>
      <h3 class="paragraph"> Hello, my name is Alex Ho. Born and raised in Australia, NSW, I'm relatively new to this whole coding, computer, basically everything technological.
        This decision to pick up programming, primarily learning HTML, CSS and JavaScript at the moment, is in response to me wanting to learn something new.
        I've recently started picking it up, but now I find that I thoroughly enjoy basic coding. I hope to develop my skills through the frequenting of coding and the development of different projects.
